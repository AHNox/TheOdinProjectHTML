		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			This meal is a tasy combination of creamy savoury flavor that packs a
			delicious punch! With all of these flavors, its hard to choose the best one
			out of them all!!!
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Oyster Crackers</li>
			<li>Potatoes</li>
			<li>Onions</li>
			<li>Garlic</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Flour</li>
			<li>Chicken Base</li>
			<li>Clams</li>
			<li>Thyme</li>
			<li>Salt and Pepper</li>
			<li>Celery</li>
			<li>Clam Juice</li>
			<li>Half and half</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>
			In a Dutch oven or large pot on the stovetop over medium heat, add bacon and
			cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from the pot with a slotted
			spoon, drain on paper towels, and crumble. Set aside.
		</p>
		<p>
			To the bacon fat, add onion and celery and cook until softened, about 5
			minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stir in potatoes, water, clam juice, and chicken base. Bring to boil, reduce
			heat, and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
			In a small bowl, whisk together 1 cup half-and-half or heavy cream and flour
			until smooth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gradually stir into soup, return to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about
			1 to 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I like 1
			teaspoon salt and Â½ teaspoon pepper). Add clams and their juice and remaining
			1 cup half-and-half and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Garnish
			each serving with bacon and oyster crackers.
