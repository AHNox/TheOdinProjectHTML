		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This sandwich is a quick simple meal that is both tasty and easy to make!
			Additionally, more sides can be added to this meal for additional flavor and
			a better eating experience!!!
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 slices rye or gluten-free bread</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons yellow mustard</li>
			<li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
			<li>
				Marinated Red Onions <strong><em>optional</em></strong>
			</li>
			<li>8 dill pickle slices ½ cup coleslaw, or more (recipe to follow)</li>
			<li>
				12 ounces pastrami <strong><em>sliced</em></strong>
			</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons light olive oil</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>
			Place 2 slices of bread on a cutting board and spread one teaspoon of mustard
			on one of the slices. On the slice with the mustard, place two slices of
			cheese and top with marinated onions and pickles.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the remaining slice, place two slices of cheese and top with 1/4 cup of
			coleslaw and 6 ounces of pastrami. Close the sandwich and set aside. Repeat
			to make a second sandwich.
		</p>
		<p>
			In a large pan over medium heat, melt the butter and olive oil. When the
			butter has melted, place the sandwiches in the pan and turn the heat down to
			medium low; cook until the bread is crispy and golden, for 3 to 4 minutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Flip the sandwiches and allow the second side to brown and crisp, an
			additional 2 to 3 minutes. Then cover the pan with a lid for an additional
			minute, or until the cheese is melted, if necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cook's Note: If you're using homemade pastrami that has been refrigerated,
			take the chill off before making the sandwich by putting it in an oven-safe
			dish with a little bit of water. Cover the dish tightly with foil and warm it
			in a 350°F oven for bout 15 minutes.
